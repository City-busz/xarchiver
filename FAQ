Q. Why ace archives are not supported ?

A. Because on some strange reasons there is no support on Linux for creating archives, only extraction with unace. When they will 
develop full support for ace archives I will add it to Xarchiver.

Q. How can I create an archive with some files password protected and others not ?

A. First of all choose 'New' and select one of arj, 7zip, rar or zip archive formats and choose 'Add' from the Action menu.
Do NOT check "Password" in the Add dialog. Add your files and then reopen the Add dialog again but this time check "Password" and 
enter your password. From now on all the files you add to the archive will be password protected. 

Q. Why does Xarchiver emit this error message when handling tar archives ?

        tar: Skipping to next header
        tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors

A. Xarchiver it's only a frontend who runs the archiver and reports ITS error messages. Most probably you are opening an archive 
produced with older versions of tar than the one you are currently using or the archive is corrupted.

Q. Why the option "Extract with full path" is disabled when using the -e switch with tar archives ?

A. Because GNU tar does not provide a full way to extract files without the directories in which they are contained as the other 
archivers do. Extraction without path when using the GUI is perfomed with a trick who is not available when using the -e switch 
from the command line.

Q. When I check Freshen or Update in the Add or Extract Dialog Xarchiver tells me an error occurred but the Error messages window is 
empty, why?

A. Please remember Xarchiver is only a frontend, it correctly reads any output from STDOUT or STDERR. most probably the archiver 
didn't write anything to those channels even though it exits with an error code.
