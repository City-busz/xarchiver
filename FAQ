Q. Why ace archives are not supported ?

A. Because on some strange reasons there is no support on Linux for creating archives, only extraction with unace. When they will 
develop full support for ace archives I will add it to Xarchiver.

Q. How can I create an archive with some files password protected and others not ?

A. First of all choose 'New' and select one of arj, 7zip, rar, zip archive formats and add the files you DON'T want to protect 
first. Then choose 'Set Password' from Action menu and type your password. From now on all the files you add to the archive will be 
password protected.

Q. Why does Xarchiver emit this error message when handling tar archives ?

        tar: Skipping to next header
        tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors

A. Xarchiver it's only a frontend who runs the archiver and reports ITS error messages. Most probably you are opening an archive 
produced with older versions of tar than the one you are currently using.

Q. When I try to delete files from .7z archives Xarchiver tells me an error occurred but the Error Messages Window is empty, why ?

A. This happens when a 7z archive has been created with the option ms=on. By default Xarchiver uses ms=off. The 7za's author hasn't
implemented yet the deletion from the archives created with ms=on. The window is empty because the error message from 7za:
E_NOTIMPL is sent to the standard output (STDOUT) and not correctly to the standard error (STDERR) that Xarchiver reads for error 
messages.

Q.When I try to view a file in a tar archive I get this:

        tar: unrecognized option `--strip-components=2'
        Try `tar --help' for more information.

A. You are using an older version of tar, please upgrade at least to 1.15.
