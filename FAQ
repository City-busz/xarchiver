Q. Why ace archives are not supported ?

A. Because on some strange reasons there is no support on Linux for creating archives, only extraction with unace. When they will 
develop full support for ace archives I will add it to Xarchiver.

Q. How can I create an archive with some files password protected and others not ?

A. First of all choose 'New' and select one of arj, 7zip, rar or zip archive formats and choose 'Add' from the Action menu.
Do NOT check "Password". Add your files and then reopen the Add dialog again but this time check "Password" and enter your password. 
From now on all the files you add to the archive will be password protected. In case you extracted some files from a password protect 
archive the Add dialog will check the password widget and will automatically enter the password in the text entry. If you don't want 
to protect the files with password simply uncheck the password widget.

Q. Why does Xarchiver emit this error message when handling tar archives ?

        tar: Skipping to next header
        tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors

A. Xarchiver it's only a frontend who runs the archiver and reports ITS error messages. Most probably you are opening an archive 
produced with older versions of tar than the one you are currently using.

Q. When I try to view a file in a tar archive I get this:

        tar: unrecognized option `--strip-components=2'
        Try `tar --help' for more information.

A. You are using an older version of tar, please upgrade at least to 1.15.
