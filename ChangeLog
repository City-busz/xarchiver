Xarchiver changelog:

16/12/05 - 0.3:
		- 7z and arj (also password protected) formats are supported if you have 7za and arj installed. 7z password
		  protected archives are not automatically detected. If you are able to decompress the main header of a 7z archive
		  let me know about it.
		- Added a view ability for text files inside the archive. No external editor needed :-) !
		- The size columns are treated as uint instead as string so that sorting by size is possible now.
		- The bottom window is now used for reporting messages to the user.
		- Added a progress bar that shows the archive's operation progress.
		- Greatly improved the zip password detection; if a an archive contains 10 files and only the last one is password 
		  protected Xarchiver will detect it (the same for arj).
		- When you open or create a password protected archive a small padlock is shown in the window bottom right.
		- Fixed an occasional crash when opening zip archives.
		- Fixed a bug causing filenames of rpm archive not displayed correctly.
		- Fixed a bug causing cpio temp file not to be deleted when an error occurs.
		- Added russian and german translation (thanks to Eugene Ostapets and Enrico Troeger).
		- Better gettext support.
