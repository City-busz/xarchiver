16/12/05 - 0.3:
		- 7z and arj (also password protected) formats are supported if you have 7za and arj installed. 7z password
		  protected archives are not automatically detected. If you are able to decompress the main header of a 7z archive
		  let me know about it.

		- The size columns are treated as uint instead as string so that sorting by size is possible now.
		- The bottom window is now used for reporting messages to the user.
		- Added a progress bar that shows the archive's operation progress.
		- Greatly improved the zip password detection; if an archive contains 10 files and only the last one is password 
		  protected Xarchiver will detect it (the same is true for arj).

		- Fixed an occasional crash when opening zip archives.
