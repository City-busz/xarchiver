Xarchiver 0.1 - Copyright @2005 Colossus - Giuseppe Torelli

Xarchiver is a GTK2 only frontend to command line archive tools such as gzip, 
bzip2, tar, rar and zip. I developed it because when I switched to Fluxbox from 
KDE I wondered that apart Ark (KDE) and File Roller (GNOME) there were no other frontends, 
so I started developing Xarchiver; later I subscribed to RSS's gnomefiles.org and so I 
knew about xarchive (without the ending r), so up to now we have two indipendent frontends,
that is good :-) !

You don't need GNOME neither KDE just gtk 2.6.x !
