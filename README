What is it?
===========

Xarchiver is a Desktop Environment independent archiver frontend. All common archive types are supported.
RPM and ISO are handled without rpm or isodump executables. To run it you only need GTK+2 libraries and
obviously the various rar, arj and 7z for these archive types. All the others archivers are installed by
default in most distro.

How to compile:
===============

./configure --prefix=/usr
make

become root with command su
make install
