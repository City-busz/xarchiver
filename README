What is it?
===========
Xarchiver is the ultimate solution for handling archives on Linux and FreeBSD.
It's a Desktop Environment independent archiver frontend. All common archive
types are supported. RPM and DEB packages are handled without their package
managers. To run it you only need GTK+2 libraries and obviously the various
rar, arj and 7z for these archive types. The package xdg-utils is optional but
installing it will enable Xarchiver to support more file types.

How to use it:
=============
Please read the documentation accessible from the Help menu.

How to compile:
===============
./autogen.sh     # only if using repository source and 'configure' is missing
./configure      # type './configure --help' for options
make

as root:
make install
