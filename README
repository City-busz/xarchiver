Xarchiver 0.2

This release adds the ability to extract and crete zip and rar password protected 
archives and to open and extract RPM files without the rpm or rpm2cpio executables.

To create a password protected archive, first create a new rar or zip archive and 
AFTER this choose Action->Set Password. Now all the files you add will be encrypted 
with the current password.

To compile xarchiver:
./configure --prefix=/usr
make

become root
make install

That's all, enjoy handling archives without GNOME or KDE libs !
