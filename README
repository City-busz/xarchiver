Xarchiver 0.2.1

This is a bug fix release, no new features. Please read the ChangeLog file.

To create a password protected archive, first create a new rar or zip archive and 
AFTER this choose Action->Set Password. Now all the files you add will be encrypted 
with the current password.

To compile xarchiver:
./configure --prefix=/usr
make

become root
make install

That's all, enjoy handling archives without GNOME or KDE libs !
